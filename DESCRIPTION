Version: 0.1.0

Description: It is often necessary to use an intercepting proxy server
    to identify targets for web-scraping. The 'PortSwigger' <https://portswigger.net/>
    'Burp' proxy records web traffic from interactive use of a browser and provides
    mechanisms to archive this activity to an XML file for further processing. Tools
    are provides to import this archive file and work with the request and response
    objects in a similar manner as one would with results of verb calls from functions
    in the 'httr' package.
